- 👋 Hi, I’m @clobochar, nice to meet you! I'm starting my journey as a frontend developer so you will find some projects and exercises I been doing so I can practice.
- 👀 I’m interested in cats, food and travel (thank God there's a comma beetwen cats and food!). I also like to play Animal Crossing, it's something I started and is really calming.
- 📫 How to reach me...well, my lastname is very unic, so if you want to reach me, just search for my lastname on Linkedin.
